### C-Style Reading Loop 



## The while Statement 



### Terminating a while Loop 

> indefinitely = permanently = infinitely
>
> finite = limited

### When a Loop Terminates 



### while: An Entry-Condition Loop 

> portion = part

### Syntax Points 

> intervention 介入

## Which Is Bigger: Using Relational Operators and Expressions 

> merit a closer look = worth a closer look
>
> pretty much = very much

> mnemonic = 助记符
>
> elicit = lead to

### What Is Truth? 



### What Else Is True? 

> notion = concept

> idiom 习语

### Troubles with Truth 

>You might wonder why, because the program keeps looping, the user doesn’t get a chance to type in any more input after entering q . When scanf() fails to read the specified form of input, it leaves the nonconforming input in place to be read the next time.
