# Preface

“Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again”

警戒自己做什么事情千万不要**浅尝辄止**。

但是如果一开始就错了，比如说我自己，直接在自己半吊子水平——谭浩强教材的C语言水平，就开始学严蔚敏老师的数据结构，面向考试学了操作系统（王道考研）。还妄图直接去学习APUE，UNP。这样下去不是浅尝辄止的讨论范畴，而是迷途不返。故重头学习C语言、英语。以求实现够用（出现对基础的疑惑知道在书籍的哪一页）的程度。
